Quick Technical Stock Analysis with Python
üìà Project Overview
This project performs a basic technical analysis of four major stocks: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Ford (F), and Cisco (CSCO). Using historical data from Yahoo Finance, it explores trends, calculates key financial metrics, and visualizes the results to determine which stock might be a better option for trading based on a simplified model.

The analysis covers the period from August 17, 2019, to August 17, 2022.

üéØ Project Objectives
Explore and observe patterns in stock data for four chosen companies over a three-year period.

Calculate and compare key metrics:

Trading Volume

Market Capitalization (Daily Dollar Volume)

Moving Averages (50-day and 200-day)

Volatility and Stability (Daily Returns)

Analyze correlations between different financial variables.

Determine which of the four stocks presents a potentially better trading option based on the analysis.
